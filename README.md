## ðŸ“Œ **Introduction**

This repository contains the official implementation of our paper:  
ðŸ“„ *Frequency-Compensated Network for Daily Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Prediction, IEEE TGRS 2025*

Frequency-Compensated Network (FCNet) is designed for Arctic SIC prediction. In particular, we design a dual-branch network, including branches for frequency feature extraction and convolutional feature extraction. For frequency feature extraction, we design an adaptive frequency filter block, which integrates trainable layers with Fourier-based filters. By adding frequency features, the FCNet can achieve refined prediction of edges and details. For convolutional feature extraction, we propose a high-frequency enhancement block to separate high and low-frequency information. Moreover, high-frequency features are enhanced via channel-wise attention, and temporal attention unit is employed for low-frequency feature extraction to capture long-range sea ice changes. 

Code and data will be updated soon ...
